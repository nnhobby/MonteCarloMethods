Notations
==========

We use blackboard bold to denote set, and vectors are denoted by bold little letters.
Random numbers and vectors are usually denoted by capital letters.

:math:`\Z` : set of integers

:math:`\R` : set of real numbers

:math:`\R^d` : set of d-tuple of real numbers

:math:`X, Y, ...` : random variables

:math:`\P` : probability distribution

:math:`f_X(\x) = \P(X = \x)`: probability mass function for discrete event

:math:`F_X(\x) = \P(X \le \x)` : cumulative distribution function

PDF: probability density function

:math:`\mu = \E(X)`: expectation or mean of :math:`X`

:math:`\sigma^2 = \E(X - \mu)^2 = \mathrm{Var}(X)`: variance of :math:`X`
